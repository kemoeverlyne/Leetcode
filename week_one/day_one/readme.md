# Day 1: Review Basic Data Structures

## Arrays

### Declaration and Initialization

- Review how to declare and initialize arrays in your programming language of choice.

### Accessing Elements

- Refresh your knowledge of how to access elements in an array using indices (0-based indexing).

### Common Operations

- Practice appending elements to the end, inserting elements at specific positions, and deleting elements.

### LeetCode Practice

- Solve basic array-related problems on LeetCode to reinforce your understanding. Start with simple problems and gradually increase the complexity.

## Linked Lists

### Singly Linked Lists

- Understand the structure of singly linked lists, including nodes and their next pointers.

### Doubly Linked Lists

- Review the structure of doubly linked lists, which have nodes with both forward and backward pointers.

### Operations

- Practice creating nodes, traversing the list, inserting nodes at different positions, and deleting nodes. Pay attention to edge cases.

## Stacks and Queues

### Stacks (LIFO)

- Understand the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) nature of stacks.
- Implement a stack using an array or a linked list.
- Implement stack operations like `push()` and `pop()`.

### Queues (FIFO)

- Understand the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) nature of queues.
- Implement a queue using an array or a linked list.
- Implement queue operations like `enqueue()` and `dequeue()`.

### Use Cases

- Refresh your understanding of when to use stacks and queues, and consider practical scenarios.

### Practice

- Create practical examples and solve problems that involve stacks and queues to reinforce your understanding.
